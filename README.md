# Exercise one: How well do you understand?

Read the following text samples and try to figure out what they mean:

## Sample Text 1

"All individuals who work with children or vulnerable adults, or have unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults in the ordinary course of their employment, or in the practice of an occupation, or during the course of an education program and who are employed by or licensed by, or receive regular ongoing operating funds from the provincial government are covered under the Criminal Records Review Act."

## My thoughts on Sample Text 1

This massive sentence lists people who are covered by some legal act. I would rewrite it this way:

"The Criminal Records Review Act covers you if:

- You work with children or vulnerable adults
- You have unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults in a work or education environment
- You are employed by or licensed by the provincial government
- You receive regular operating funds from the provincial government"

## Sample Text 2

"Under the Criminal Records Review Act, you must have a criminal record review conducted by the Criminal Records Review Program (CRRP) if you:

- Work with children or vulnerable adults, or
- Have unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults during your employment, occupation or education, or
- Are licensed by or receiving funding from the provincial government"

## My thoughts after reading Sample 2

Strangely, Sample 2 does not have 'employed by the provincial government' but I guess 'receiving funding' counts?

What I did well:

- My answer was broken up into a list.

What I can do better:

- I lacked domain knowledge - I simply rewrote what was given to me. For example, I said 'The Criminal Records Review Act covers you'. But Sample Text explains more about an actual review being conducted.
- Sample Text 2 has 'or' after each point.
- Sample Text 2 has 'if you' which further removes one word from each list item.

# Exercise two: What are they trying to say?

What is really being said in the following real‐world writing samples?

> 1. A doctor records on a patient’s chart: "Patient failed to fulfill his wellness potential.”

A doctor records on a patient's chart that they are not well OR their X biomarkers are higher/lower than usual.

> 2. U.S. Army talks about "vertically deployed anti‐personnel devices."

Sounds like a killing robot. Drones? Sentries? Tall killing machines?

> 3. Civilian mechanics at a McClellan Air Force base in California are placed on "non‐duty, non‐pay status.”

The mechanics are fired or on garden leave.

> 4. The Massachusetts Department of Public Works speaks of "ground‐mounted confirmatory route markers.”

New signs have been put on the roads, or the roads have clearer markings.

> 5. A store in St. Louis advertises "semi‐antique" rugs

Second-hand rugs?

# Exercise three: Website comparison

Below are two websites for you to visit. 

Start by clicking each link to load up the sites in new windows or tabs, but try to avoid looking at the pages right away.

For each one:

- Set a timer for 10 seconds
- View the page
- Hide the page from view and write down everything you remember about what was on it

## Sample page #1 - the horrible page

- There is a picture with a strange shape with a hole in it.
- The shape is orange and it's apparently called a doohickey.
- There are some text descriptions about this shape.
- There are instructions on the page to clean it.

## Sample page #2 - cleaned up version

All of the things I mentioned for sample page 1 and:

- The page design is much clearer now.
- It is clear that this doohickey is a product that you can buy.
- There is a link included for the customer to buy it (call to action).

## Reflection

10 seconds was definitely not enough time for me. I couldn't even read any text in detail because I panicked. After spending more time comparing those pages, I disagree with all my previous comments about page 2.

- Doohickey just means 'I don't know what that small thing is'. Maybe the author should've picked another word! (consider your audience).
- The page design is horrible on page 2, there are no headings. Page 1 has way more headings for easy skimming.
- I know it would take at least 2 or 3 times longer to read page 2, because there are no headings.
- There was actually a link in sample page 1 as well, but I didn't notice it the first time. It is more noticeable on page 2 because it's at the top.

# Exercise four: A structured overview

Below is a jumbled paragraph about a common North American breakfast food. 

Try to unscramble the information and draft an outline of appropriate headings that could help to structure this information in a more logical and helpful way.

> Toast is most commonly eaten with butter or margarine spread over it, and may be served with preserves, spreads, or other toppings in addition to or instead of butter. You may need more slices because it is so good. Later, simple devices were created to toast bread in the fire, such as wire frames to cook the toast more evenly. Some sandwiches, such as the BLT, call for toast to be used rather than bread. The practice of toasting bread became popular in the Roman Empire. Toast with jam or marmalade is popular. The word “toast” actually comes from the Latin “tostum,” which means “to burn or scorch.” You will need a toaster and a slice of bread.  Toast is  considered by many to be delicious! The first breads were likely toasted by laying them in front of the fire on a hot stone. Toast is a common breakfast food.

## My answers (unscrambling then creating groups):

- About Toast
  - Toast is a common breakfast food.
  - Toast is considered by many to be delicious!
- What can you eat with it
  - Toast is most commonly eaten with butter or margarine spread over it, and may be served with preserves, spreads, or other toppings in addition to or instead of butter.
  - Toast with jam or marmalade is popular.
  - Some sandwiches, such as the BLT, call for toast to be used rather than bread.
  - You will need a toaster and a slice of bread.
  - You may need more slices because it is so good.
- History of Toast
  - The word “toast” actually comes from the Latin “tostum,” which means “to burn or scorch.”
  - The practice of toasting bread became popular in the Roman Empire.
  - The first breads were likely toasted by laying them in front of the fire on a hot stone.
  - Later, simple devices were created to toast bread in the fire, such as wire frames to cook the toast more evenly.

# Exercise five: Chunking and headings

Practise chunking and headings.

1. Break the text into smaller pieces based on key topics
2. Add a relevant heading to each chunk

> In the United States, large globe artichokes are frequently prepared by removing all but 5–10 mm of the stem. Sometimes they may have thorns which can interfere with eating. To remove thorns, around a quarter of each scale can be cut off. To cook, the artichoke is boiled or steamed. A cooked, unseasoned artichoke has a delicate flavour. While the outer stem is often tough and bitter, the core of the stem tastes similar to the artichoke heart, and is edible. Salt may be added to the water if boiling artichokes. Covered artichokes, in particular those that have been cut, can turn brown due to enzymatic browning and chlorophyll oxidation. Placing them in water slightly acidified with vinegar or lemon juice can prevent the discoloration. Leaves are often removed one at a time, and the fleshy base eaten with hollandaise, vinegar, butter, mayonnaise, aioli, lemon juice, or other sauces. The fibrous upper part of each leaf is usually discarded. The heart is eaten when the inedible choke has been peeled away from the base and discarded. The thin leaves covering the choke are also edible.

## My answers

**Artichoke preparation**

In the United States, large globe artichokes are frequently prepared by removing all but 5–10 mm of the stem. Sometimes they may have thorns which can interfere with eating. To remove thorns, around a quarter of each scale can be cut off. To cook, the artichoke is boiled or steamed.

**Artichoke taste**

A cooked, unseasoned artichoke has a delicate flavour. While the outer stem is often tough and bitter, the core of the stem tastes similar to the artichoke heart, and is edible. Salt may be added to the water if boiling artichokes. 

**Prevent browning**

Covered artichokes, in particular those that have been cut, can turn brown due to enzymatic browning and chlorophyll oxidation. Placing them in water slightly acidified with vinegar or lemon juice can prevent the discoloration.

**How to eat**

Leaves are often removed one at a time, and the fleshy base eaten with hollandaise, vinegar, butter, mayonnaise, aioli, lemon juice, or other sauces. The fibrous upper part of each leaf is usually discarded. The heart is eaten when the inedible choke has been peeled away from the base and discarded. The thin leaves covering the choke are also edible.

## Reflection

After reading the [takeaways](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/web-content-development-guides/web-style-guide/plain-language-course/exercise-5-takeaways), here are my thoughts:

- The instructions did not tell me to rewrite anything. Yet, the answer in the takeaways did change some of the content!
- The chunking and headings were the same as my answers, except for the second one. Mine is about the taste whereas the sample answer is 'Cooking'.
- I am pleased that even some of the headings matched the sample answers.

## Bonus exercise

The takeaways has this bonus exercise for me:

> Note that a lot more could be done to convert the text above to plain language. For example, the entire passage is written in the passive voice. Try changing it to the active voice and revising the text further after you complete Exercise Nine.

My answer (I have assumed the audience is a cookbook reader):

**Preparation**

In the United States, people often prepare large globe artichokes by removing all but 5–10 mm of the stem. Sometimes the thorns can interfere with eating. To remove the thorns, you can cut off around a quarter of each scale.

**Cooking**

You can boil or steam the artichoke to cook it. A cooked, unseasoned artichoke has a delicate flavour. You can add salt to the water if boiling artichokes.

**Prevent browning**

Covered artichokes can turn brown due to enzymatic browning and chlorophyll oxidation, in particular those that have been cut. To prevent this, place them in water slightly acidified with vinegar or lemon juice.

**Eating an artichoke**

Leaves are often removed one at a time, and the fleshy base eaten with:

- hollandaise
- vinegar
- butter
- mayonnaise
- aioli
- lemon juice
- or other sauces.

The fibrous upper part of each leaf is usually discarded. The heart is eaten when the inedible choke has been peeled away from the base and discarded. While the outer stem is often tough and bitter, the edible core of the stem tastes similar to the artichoke heart. The thin leaves covering the choke are also edible.

# Exercise six: Latinate

For fun, try to translate the following Latinate back into everyday expressions.

1. Scintillate, scintillate, asteroid diminutive. 
2. Members of an avian species with identical plumage will congregate. 
3. It is futile to become lachrymose over precipitately departed lacteal fluids. 
4. The stylus is more potent than the claymore.
5. It is fruitless to indoctrinate a superannuated canine with innovative manoeuvers. 

## My answers

Oh great, I might not even have the vocabulary power for this. I might need to use a dictionary. But let's try without a dictionary first.

1. No idea, I know scintillating is like... interesting?
2. Birds of a feather flock together.
3. You can't dry something that's wet (pure guess).
4. Something to do with making peace, not war? Pen vs sword?
5. You can't teach an old dog new tricks.

## After reflecting on the takeaways

1. Oh right, scintillate actually means to shine. Twinkle, twinkle, little star!
2. I nailed this one.
3. Oh right, no use crying over spilled milk!
4. Oh right, the pen is mightier than the sword!
5. I nailed this one.
