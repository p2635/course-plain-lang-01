# Plain Language Course – Exercise File

This text file are my answers to the [plain language exercises](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/web-content-development-guides/web-style-guide/plain-language-course/plain-language-exercises) on the British Columbia gov website.

# Exercise One: How Well do you Understand?

Read the following text samples and try to figure out what they mean:

## Sample Text 1

"All individuals who work with children or vulnerable adults, or have unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults in the ordinary course of their employment, or in the practice of an occupation, or during the course of an education program and who are employed by or licensed by, or receive regular ongoing operating funds from the provincial government are covered under the Criminal Records Review Act."

My thoughts:

This massive sentence lists people who are covered by some legal act.

My rewrite:

The Criminal Records Review Act covers you if:

- You work with children or vulnerable adults
- You have unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults in a work or education environment
- You are employed by or licensed by the provincial government
- You receive regular operating funds from the provincial government

## Sample Text 2

"Under the Criminal Records Review Act, you must have a criminal record review conducted by the Criminal Records Review Program (CRRP) if you:

- Work with children or vulnerable adults, or
- Have unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults during your employment, occupation or education, or
- Are licensed by or receiving funding from the provincial government"

My thoughts after reading Sample 2.

- Strangely, Sample 2 does not have 'employed by the provincial government' but I guess 'receiving funding' counts?

What I did well (Acknowledge):

- My answer was broken up into a list

What I can do better:

- I lacked domain knowledge - I simply rewrote what was given to me. For example, I said 'The Criminal Records Review Act covers you'. But Sample Text explains more about an actual review being conducted.
- Sample Text 2 has 'or' after each point.
- Sample Text 2 has 'if you' which further removes one word from each list item.

# Exercise Two: What are they trying to say?

What is really being said in the following real‐world writing samples?

> 1. A doctor records on a patient’s chart: "Patient failed to fulfill his wellness potential.”

A doctor records on a patient's chart that they are not well OR their X biomarkers are higher/lower than usual.

> 2. U.S. Army talks about "vertically deployed anti‐personnel devices."

Sounds like a killing robot. Drones? Sentries? Tall killing machines?

> 3. Civilian mechanics at a McClellan Air Force base in California are placed on "non‐duty, non‐pay status.”

The mechanics are fired or on garden leave.

> 4. The Massachusetts Department of Public Works speaks of "ground‐mounted confirmatory route markers.”

New signs have been put on the roads, or the roads have clearer markings.

> 5. A store in St. Louis advertises "semi‐antique" rugs

Second-hand rugs?

# Exercise three: website comparison

Below are two websites for you to visit. 

Start by clicking each link to load up the sites in new windows or tabs, but try to avoid looking at the pages right away.

For each one:

- Set a timer for 10 seconds
- View the page
- Hide the page from view and write down everything you remember about what was on it

## Sample page #1 - the horrible page

- There is a picture with a strange shape with a hole in it.
- The shape is orange and it's apparently called a doohickey.
- There are some text descriptions about this shape.
- There are instructions on the page to clean it.

## Sample page #2 - cleaned up version

All of the things I mentioned for sample page 1 and:

- The page design is much clearer now.
- It is clear that this doohickey is a product that you can buy.
- There is a link included for the customer to buy it (call to action).

## Reflection

10 seconds was definitely not enough time for me. I couldn't even read any text in detail because I panicked. After spending more time comparing those pages, I disagree with all my previous comments about page 2.

- Doohickey just means 'I don't know what that small thing is'. Maybe the author should've picked another word! (consider your audience).
- The page design is horrible on page 2, there are no headings. Page 1 has way more headings for easy skimming.
- I know it would take at least 2 or 3 times longer to read page 2, because there are no headings.
- It is already clear that both pages have links to buy the product. As I said, I panicked so I must've missed it the first time.
- There was actually a link in sample page 1 as well, but I didn't notice it the first time. It is more noticeable on page 2 because it's at the top.
