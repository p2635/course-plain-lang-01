# Exercise one: How well do you understand?

Read the following text samples and try to figure out what they mean:

## Sample Text 1

"All individuals who work with children or vulnerable adults, or have unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults in the ordinary course of their employment, or in the practice of an occupation, or during the course of an education program and who are employed by or licensed by, or receive regular ongoing operating funds from the provincial government are covered under the Criminal Records Review Act."

## My thoughts on Sample Text 1

This massive sentence lists people who are covered by some legal act. I would rewrite it this way:

"The Criminal Records Review Act covers you if:

- You work with children or vulnerable adults
- You have unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults in a work or education environment
- You are employed by or licensed by the provincial government
- You receive regular operating funds from the provincial government"

## Sample Text 2

"Under the Criminal Records Review Act, you must have a criminal record review conducted by the Criminal Records Review Program (CRRP) if you:

- Work with children or vulnerable adults, or
- Have unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults during your employment, occupation or education, or
- Are licensed by or receiving funding from the provincial government"

## My thoughts after reading Sample 2

Strangely, Sample 2 does not have 'employed by the provincial government' but I guess 'receiving funding' counts?

What I did well:

- My answer was broken up into a list.

What I can do better:

- I lacked domain knowledge - I simply rewrote what was given to me. For example, I said 'The Criminal Records Review Act covers you'. But Sample Text explains more about an actual review being conducted.
- Sample Text 2 has 'or' after each point.
- Sample Text 2 has 'if you' which further removes one word from each list item.

# Exercise two: What are they trying to say?

What is really being said in the following real‐world writing samples?

> 1. A doctor records on a patient’s chart: "Patient failed to fulfill his wellness potential.”

A doctor records on a patient's chart that they are not well OR their X biomarkers are higher/lower than usual.

> 2. U.S. Army talks about "vertically deployed anti‐personnel devices."

Sounds like a killing robot. Drones? Sentries? Tall killing machines?

> 3. Civilian mechanics at a McClellan Air Force base in California are placed on "non‐duty, non‐pay status.”

The mechanics are fired or on garden leave.

> 4. The Massachusetts Department of Public Works speaks of "ground‐mounted confirmatory route markers.”

New signs have been put on the roads, or the roads have clearer markings.

> 5. A store in St. Louis advertises "semi‐antique" rugs

Second-hand rugs?

# Exercise three: Website comparison

Below are two websites for you to visit. 

Start by clicking each link to load up the sites in new windows or tabs, but try to avoid looking at the pages right away.

For each one:

- Set a timer for 10 seconds
- View the page
- Hide the page from view and write down everything you remember about what was on it

## Sample page #1 - the horrible page

- There is a picture with a strange shape with a hole in it.
- The shape is orange and it's apparently called a doohickey.
- There are some text descriptions about this shape.
- There are instructions on the page to clean it.

## Sample page #2 - cleaned up version

All of the things I mentioned for sample page 1 and:

- The page design is much clearer now.
- It is clear that this doohickey is a product that you can buy.
- There is a link included for the customer to buy it (call to action).

## Reflection

10 seconds was definitely not enough time for me. I couldn't even read any text in detail because I panicked. After spending more time comparing those pages, I disagree with all my previous comments about page 2.

- Doohickey just means 'I don't know what that small thing is'. Maybe the author should've picked another word! (consider your audience).
- The page design is horrible on page 2, there are no headings. Page 1 has way more headings for easy skimming.
- I know it would take at least 2 or 3 times longer to read page 2, because there are no headings.
- There was actually a link in sample page 1 as well, but I didn't notice it the first time. It is more noticeable on page 2 because it's at the top.

# Exercise four: A structured overview

Below is a jumbled paragraph about a common North American breakfast food. 

Try to unscramble the information and draft an outline of appropriate headings that could help to structure this information in a more logical and helpful way.

> Toast is most commonly eaten with butter or margarine spread over it, and may be served with preserves, spreads, or other toppings in addition to or instead of butter. You may need more slices because it is so good. Later, simple devices were created to toast bread in the fire, such as wire frames to cook the toast more evenly. Some sandwiches, such as the BLT, call for toast to be used rather than bread. The practice of toasting bread became popular in the Roman Empire. Toast with jam or marmalade is popular. The word “toast” actually comes from the Latin “tostum,” which means “to burn or scorch.” You will need a toaster and a slice of bread.  Toast is  considered by many to be delicious! The first breads were likely toasted by laying them in front of the fire on a hot stone. Toast is a common breakfast food.

## My answers (unscrambling then creating groups):

- About Toast
  - Toast is a common breakfast food.
  - Toast is considered by many to be delicious!
- What can you eat with it
  - Toast is most commonly eaten with butter or margarine spread over it, and may be served with preserves, spreads, or other toppings in addition to or instead of butter.
  - Toast with jam or marmalade is popular.
  - Some sandwiches, such as the BLT, call for toast to be used rather than bread.
  - You will need a toaster and a slice of bread.
  - You may need more slices because it is so good.
- History of Toast
  - The word “toast” actually comes from the Latin “tostum,” which means “to burn or scorch.”
  - The practice of toasting bread became popular in the Roman Empire.
  - The first breads were likely toasted by laying them in front of the fire on a hot stone.
  - Later, simple devices were created to toast bread in the fire, such as wire frames to cook the toast more evenly.

# Exercise five: Chunking and headings

Practise chunking and headings.

1. Break the text into smaller pieces based on key topics
2. Add a relevant heading to each chunk

> In the United States, large globe artichokes are frequently prepared by removing all but 5–10 mm of the stem. Sometimes they may have thorns which can interfere with eating. To remove thorns, around a quarter of each scale can be cut off. To cook, the artichoke is boiled or steamed. A cooked, unseasoned artichoke has a delicate flavour. While the outer stem is often tough and bitter, the core of the stem tastes similar to the artichoke heart, and is edible. Salt may be added to the water if boiling artichokes. Covered artichokes, in particular those that have been cut, can turn brown due to enzymatic browning and chlorophyll oxidation. Placing them in water slightly acidified with vinegar or lemon juice can prevent the discoloration. Leaves are often removed one at a time, and the fleshy base eaten with hollandaise, vinegar, butter, mayonnaise, aioli, lemon juice, or other sauces. The fibrous upper part of each leaf is usually discarded. The heart is eaten when the inedible choke has been peeled away from the base and discarded. The thin leaves covering the choke are also edible.

(Text adapted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artichoke)

## My answers

**Artichoke preparation**

In the United States, large globe artichokes are frequently prepared by removing all but 5–10 mm of the stem. Sometimes they may have thorns which can interfere with eating. To remove thorns, around a quarter of each scale can be cut off. To cook, the artichoke is boiled or steamed.

**Artichoke taste**

A cooked, unseasoned artichoke has a delicate flavour. While the outer stem is often tough and bitter, the core of the stem tastes similar to the artichoke heart, and is edible. Salt may be added to the water if boiling artichokes. 

**Prevent browning**

Covered artichokes, in particular those that have been cut, can turn brown due to enzymatic browning and chlorophyll oxidation. Placing them in water slightly acidified with vinegar or lemon juice can prevent the discoloration.

**How to eat**

Leaves are often removed one at a time, and the fleshy base eaten with hollandaise, vinegar, butter, mayonnaise, aioli, lemon juice, or other sauces. The fibrous upper part of each leaf is usually discarded. The heart is eaten when the inedible choke has been peeled away from the base and discarded. The thin leaves covering the choke are also edible.

## Reflection

After reading the [takeaways](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/web-content-development-guides/web-style-guide/plain-language-course/exercise-5-takeaways), here are my thoughts:

- The instructions did not tell me to rewrite anything. Yet, the answer in the takeaways did change some of the content!
- The chunking and headings were the same as my answers, except for the second one. Mine is about the taste whereas the sample answer is 'Cooking'.
- I am pleased that even some of the headings matched the sample answers.

## Bonus exercise

The takeaways has this bonus exercise for me:

> Note that a lot more could be done to convert the text above to plain language. For example, the entire passage is written in the passive voice. Try changing it to the active voice and revising the text further after you complete Exercise Nine.

My answer (I have assumed the audience is a cookbook reader):

**Preparation**

In the United States, people often prepare large globe artichokes by removing all but 5–10 mm of the stem. Sometimes the thorns can interfere with eating. To remove the thorns, you can cut off around a quarter of each scale.

**Cooking**

You can boil or steam the artichoke to cook it. A cooked, unseasoned artichoke has a delicate flavour. You can add salt to the water if boiling artichokes.

**Prevent browning**

Covered artichokes can turn brown due to enzymatic browning and chlorophyll oxidation, in particular those that have been cut. To prevent this, place them in water slightly acidified with vinegar or lemon juice.

**Eating an artichoke**

Leaves are often removed one at a time, and the fleshy base eaten with:

- hollandaise
- vinegar
- butter
- mayonnaise
- aioli
- lemon juice
- or other sauces.

The fibrous upper part of each leaf is usually discarded. The heart is eaten when the inedible choke has been peeled away from the base and discarded. While the outer stem is often tough and bitter, the edible core of the stem tastes similar to the artichoke heart. The thin leaves covering the choke are also edible.

# Exercise six: Latinate

For fun, try to translate the following Latinate back into everyday expressions.

1. Scintillate, scintillate, asteroid diminutive. 
2. Members of an avian species with identical plumage will congregate. 
3. It is futile to become lachrymose over precipitately departed lacteal fluids. 
4. The stylus is more potent than the claymore.
5. It is fruitless to indoctrinate a superannuated canine with innovative manoeuvers. 

## My answers

Oh great, I might not even have the vocabulary power for this. I might need to use a dictionary. But let's try without a dictionary first.

1. No idea, I know scintillating is like... interesting?
2. Birds of a feather flock together.
3. You can't dry something that's wet (pure guess).
4. Something to do with making peace, not war? Pen vs sword?
5. You can't teach an old dog new tricks.

## After reflecting on the takeaways

1. Oh right, scintillate actually means to shine. Twinkle, twinkle, little star!
2. I nailed this one.
3. Oh right, no use crying over spilled milk!
4. Oh right, the pen is mightier than the sword!
5. I nailed this one.

# Exercise seven: sentence shortening

Break the following sentences into two to simplify them:

1. The human resources department will process your unemployment insurance application and let you know within two weeks if you are successful.
2. Once you are hired you will require first aid training but be aware that the training will have to occur before your first day of work.
3. Although the ministry requires you to apply for coverage before your contract is up, Form B can be submitted anytime during the calendar year whether or not your contract is completed. 

## My answers

My answers were pretty much spot on with the sample answers. I changed a few things for simpler language.

1. The human resources department will process your unemployment insurance application. You will know if you are successful within two weeks.
2. Once you are hired, you will need first aid training. Note that the training must happen before your first day of work.
3. The ministry needs you to apply for coverage before your contract ends. However, you can submit Form B anytime whether or not your contract has finished.

# Exercise eight: cut wordy phrases

As this exercise was a table of matching pairs, I decided only to include my answer here. In case it is not clear, the format here is word phrase -> short phrase.

- a number of, many
- owing to the fact that, because
- at the present time, now
- in a timely manner, promptly (even though I would use soon)
- in an effort to, to
- make a modification to, change
- in regard to, about
- provide the opportunity for, let
- it is requested that you, please
- in the event of, if
- after this is accomplished, then

I scored 100% here, it was quite easy really. The challenge is spotting what _my version of these are_. For example, my bad habits at work are using 'with regards to' and 'in order to'.

# Exercise nine: changing verbs from passive to active

My answers are the second sentence in each point.

1. The effects of an opioid overdose can be reversed by Naloxone. -> Naloxone can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose.
2. Today in a speech to the Union of BC Municipalities, a new program was announced by the premier. -> Today in a speech to the Union of BC Municipalities, the premier announced a new program.
3. The citizens of B.C. are served by B.C.'s elected leaders and public servants. -> In B.C., the elected leaders and public servants serve its citizens.
4. One type of air pollution is caused by hydrocarbons. -> Hydrocarbons cause one type of air pollution.
5. The dividends of a strong and diversified economy and prudent fiscal management are delivered by British Columbia's fifth-consecutive balanced budget. ->  British Columbia's fifth-consecutive balanced budget delivered the dividends of a strong and diversified economy and prudent fiscal management.
6. It was decided by the court that the contract was unconstitutional. -> The court decided that the contract was unconstitutional.
7. The kayak was invented by Indigenous people for transportation and fishing. -> The Indigenous people invented the kayak for transportation and fishing.
8. The original trusses and the repair were designed by the same registered professional. -> The same registered professional designed the original trusses and the repair.
9. The tax applies even if the insurance was purchased by a non-resident on your behalf. -> The tax applies even if a non-resident purchased the insurance on your behalf.
10. Today's blog was written by staff working on elder abuse prevention. -> The staff working on elder abuse prevention wrote today's blog.

# Exercise ten: sentence simplification

My answers are the second sentence in each point.

1. She is going to order supplies for the party. -> She will order supplies for the party / She will order party supplies (a bit too short for my liking).
2. She organized a meeting during which she consulted with the director. -> She organized a meeting when she consulted the director.
3. The training gives you the opportunity to increase your skills and abilities in using CMS Lite. -> The training lets you improve your CMS Lite skills.
4. I am interested in the topic about which you wrote. -> I'm interested in the topic you wrote about. 
5. There is no current estimate of the number of boxes of records in the possession of the school. -> There is no current estimate of how many boxes of records the school owns.
6. A knowledge of correct web style is the duty of all of the writers of the content of this website. -> All the content writers are responsible for correct web style for this website.
7. The politician responded to the allegations with vehemence. -> The politician responded strongly to the allegations.

9. Their attempt to achieve a reduction in paperwork was unsuccessful. -> They failed to reduce the paperwork.
10. The best outcome for this scenario would be a change in policy. -> A change in policy is the best outcome here.
11. It is imperative that you do not leave the waffle iron belonging to Tom unattended as it has a broken fuse and it could catch fire. -> Do not leave Tom's waffle iron unattended. It could catch fire because of a broken fuse.

Reflections (overall, my answers were not bad).

- Number 2 - It seems I misunderstood this. The simplified version was just 'She consulted with the director'.
- Number 5 - "We have no current estimate of how many boxes of records the school possesses. (Reduce prepositions)". I like how the sample answer changes 'There is no' into 'We have no'.
- Number 6 - 'All content writers for this website must know correct web style'. My answer was not bad, but the sample answer is still simpler.
- I can improve if I continue to look at for unnecessary prepositions (is, to, since, than, on, as, at, by, for, after).

# Exercise eleven: evaluating sample text

Here is some sample text for review:

> Effective June 1, 2017, in response to client feedback, hiring managers are no longer required to submit competition documentation to the BC Public Service Agency to confirm a hire.
>
> Eliminating the requirement to submit competition documentation to complete a hire does not remove the requirement for hiring managers to retain competition documentation. Hiring managers are still responsible for documenting and retaining all competition files, as they currently do, for a minimum of two years.

Instructions:

1. Copy the text into Microsoft Word.
2. Use the spell checker to obtain a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level for the page. Aim for a grade 6-8 reading level.
3. Use what you have learned in this course and the Plain Language Checklist to edit the text. Simplify, clarify, and improve the content.
4. Use Hemingway App to review the page content for additional tips.

## My revised text

**Change for Hiring Managers from June 1, 2017**

From June, you don't need to send competition files to the BC Public Service Agency to confirm a hire. This does not mean to stop retaining competition files. Continue to document and retain all competition files for at least two years.

## The sample answer

> Hiring managers must keep competition files for at least two years. They don't need to submit them to the BC Public Service Agency. This policy changed June 1, 2017.

- It seems they removed the part about 'to confirm a hire'. I am not sure if there are other circumstances where they have to send competition files. This is something I would check in real life, before I am confident enough to remove it.
- I like how they moved the most important part to the beginning. The part about continuing to keep the competition files.
- I don't like how it says 'This policy changed' because I thought this was meant to be written from the POV that its ABOUT to change.
- I do like how the date is moved to the end. This is usually the case with any usual deadlines for school or work assignments.
- It looks like I added a heading but they didn't. I feel proud. 💪

# Exercise twelve: evaluate a page using a plain language checklist

This exercise is the same as Exercise 11 except that you have the opportunity to select the text you want to edit.

Here is an article that I read about accessibility:

> A Philosophical Definition
> 
> In defining and promoting accessibility, it’s important to properly differentiate the problem and purpose of accessibility. Let’s return to architectural design for an example. When a person utilizing a wheelchair for mobility encounters a curb, there clearly exists an instance of in-access (a lack or limitation of access). It’s important to note here, that the wheelchair, or even the need for the wheelchair, is not the problem. The wheelchair is the legitimate means of mobility; the curb is the problem. This may seem obvious, but this distinction is seldom translated to the realm of content accessibility. Rather than viewing improperly formatted content, or poorly written code as the problem, a person’s disability and use of assistive technology is seen by some as the issue to overcome. However, writing, coding, and designing for equitable access is not about solving disability as a problem; it’s about accepting and respecting the solutions and technologies that enable alternate means of access, and then not constructing obstacles to their use.
>
> Source: What is Accessibility? (SeeWriteHear, https://www.seewritehear.com/learn/what-is-accessibility). Accessed 1st December 2023.
>

It's interesting that this is their mission:

> Pursuing information equality for people with disabilities by creating content, researching new technologies, and providing education for clients at all levels of government and business.

...yet I find it hard to read.

## Hemingway test - this is what it came out with

- Hemingway grade 12
- 4 adverbs. Aim for 1 or fewer.
- 1 use of passive voice, meeting the goal of 2 or fewer.
- 2 phrases have simpler alternatives.
- 1 of 9 sentences is hard to read.
- 4 of 9 sentences are very hard to read.

## Here is my rewrite in plain language

**What is the purpose and problem of accessibility?**

Answering this question helps you effectively define and promote accessibility in your context. Let's go back to our architectural design example. When a wheelchair user meets a curb, is the problem the wheelchair or the user? No, the wheelchair serves to help the user move. The accessibility problem is the curb.

You may think this is obvious, but it's often a real problem with content accessibility. Some think the problem is the person's disability or the use of assistive technology. Instead, those people could check for poorly formatted content or written code. Designing for equitable access is not about solving disability as a problem. You should accept and respect solutions that enable alternate ways to access. At the same time, consider if you are creating obstacles for those with special needs.
