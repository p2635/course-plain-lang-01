# Exercise One: How Well do you Understand?

Read the following text samples and try to figure out what they mean:

## Sample Text 1

"All individuals who work with children or vulnerable adults, or have unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults in the ordinary course of their employment, or in the practice of an occupation, or during the course of an education program and who are employed by or licensed by, or receive regular ongoing operating funds from the provincial government are covered under the Criminal Records Review Act."

My thoughts:

This massive sentence lists people who are covered by some legal act.

My rewrite:

The Criminal Records Review Act covers you if:

- You work with children or vulnerable adults
- You have unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults in a work or education environment
- You are employed by or licensed by the provincial government
- You receive regular operating funds from the provincial government

## Sample Text 2

"Under the Criminal Records Review Act, you must have a criminal record review conducted by the Criminal Records Review Program (CRRP) if you:

- Work with children or vulnerable adults, or
- Have unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults during your employment, occupation or education, or
- Are licensed by or receiving funding from the provincial government"

My thoughts after reading Sample 2.

- Strangely, Sample 2 does not have 'employed by the provincial government' but I guess 'receiving funding' counts?

What I did well (Acknowledge):

- My answer was broken up into a list

What I can do better:

- I lacked domain knowledge - I simply rewrote what was given to me. For example, I said 'The Criminal Records Review Act covers you'. But Sample Text explains more about an actual review being conducted.
- Sample Text 2 has 'or' after each point.
- Sample Text 2 has 'if you' which further removes one word from each list item.

# Exercise Two: What are they trying to say?

What is really being said in the following real‐world writing samples?

> 1. A doctor records on a patient’s chart: "Patient failed to fulfill his wellness potential.”

A doctor records on a patient's chart that they are not well OR their X biomarkers are higher/lower than usual.

> 2. U.S. Army talks about "vertically deployed anti‐personnel devices."

Sounds like a killing robot. Drones? Sentries? Tall killing machines?

> 3. Civilian mechanics at a McClellan Air Force base in California are placed on "non‐duty, non‐pay status.”

The mechanics are fired or on garden leave.

> 4. The Massachusetts Department of Public Works speaks of "ground‐mounted confirmatory route markers.”

New signs have been put on the roads, or the roads have clearer markings.

> 5. A store in St. Louis advertises "semi‐antique" rugs

Second-hand rugs?
